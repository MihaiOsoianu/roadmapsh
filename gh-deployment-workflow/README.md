# GitHub Pages Deployment
The project contains a workflow that deploys any changes made to gh-deployment-workflow/index.html file to GitHub Pagesor. The workflow will also trigger upon changes made to the workflow itself .github/workflows/deploy.yml

As of now the [page](https://mihaiosoianu.github.io/roadmapsh/) only shows a simple message: `"Hello, GitHub Actions!"`

Check the project requirements at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow)
